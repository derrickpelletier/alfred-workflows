Alfred Workflows
================

Some useful Alfred workflows.
Use the files in [compiled](blob/master/compiled/) if you just want to install them.


## Node.js Docs
===========================

Query Node.js docs quickly.

Usage:
`node [version] <page> <filter>`

`version` is optional, and will default to the most recent. 

`page` will bring up the entries for a particular page or class.

`filter` boils down each entry on the page quickly, and will jump link right to that entry on enter.

Use `node all <filter>` to search the entire docs.


## Notes
